# SimVerse 2025 - Self-Driving Playground

## Problem Statement
Simulating autonomous vehicle logic and physics interactions in a realistic 3D environment is complex and requires understanding of sensors, collision detection, and vehicle dynamics. Demonstrating these concepts in an accessible, interactive format is the goal of this project.

## Solution
This project is a web-based 3D playground that visualizes LIDAR sensors, steering logic, and vehicle physics (acceleration, braking, friction) in a "Vice City" inspired environment. Users can toggle between autonomous driving logic and manual control to understand the difference.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Three.js (3D Rendering)
- Web Audio API (Sound synthesis)

## How to Run Locally
1. Repo link - <https://github.com/Mohan-1202/Self-Driving-simulation.git>.
   Direct Link - https://mohan-1202.github.io/Self-Driving-simulation/
   
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
   *   Note: While it works directly, running via a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) is recommended for best performance.
